Leetcode 392 easy 

Solution I used

```
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sc , tc = 0,0
        if len(s)==0:
            return True
        while sc < len(s) and tc < len(t):
            if s[sc] == t[tc]:
                sc+=1
                tc+=1
            else:
                tc+=1
        
        if sc == len(s):
            return True
        else:
            return False            
```

Make a counter for both s and t and increment it by s and t ctr by 1 whenever we see matching element else increment t ptr.
Iterate through both loops till one of them reaches the end
Subsequence exisits only if s ctr is equal to the len of s
