Leetcode 1299 easy

Solution  I Used

```
class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        m = -1

        for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):
            
            v = arr[i]
            arr[i] = m
            m = max(v,arr[i])
        return arr

```

initialise m as -1 
iterate through the loop from the end , use a temporary variable and store the value of the last element.
make the last element as m
check the greater element as temporary or prev max element.
